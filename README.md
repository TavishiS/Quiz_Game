This is a C program for a fun Quiz Game.
The game comprises multiple levels : Easy, Medium and Hard.
The player is given the instructions to play before the Quiz begins.
After each answer entered by the player, it is indicated whether it was a correct/wrong answer.
Correct answers are indicated by "Green" colour, while the Wrong ones are indicated by "Red" colour.
The score of the player is displayed once the quiz ends.
This project helped me in learning the basics of C programming language concepts, such as switch case, if-else statements and colour coding.
