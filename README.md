1. This is a C program for a fun Quiz Game.<br />
2. The game comprises multiple levels : Easy, Medium and Hard.<br />
3. The player is given the instructions to play before the Quiz begins.<br />
4. After each answer entered by the player, it is indicated whether it was a correct/wrong answer.<br />
5. Correct answers are indicated by "Green" colour, while the Wrong ones are indicated by "Red" colour.<br />
6. The score of the player is displayed once the quiz ends.<br />
7. This project helped me in learning the basics of C programming language concepts, such as switch case, if-else statements and colour coding.
